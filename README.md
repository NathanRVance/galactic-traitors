# Galactic Traitors

This game is in the early stages of development, that is, it isn't really a game yet. So if you're looking for a game, come back later.

To build and run, after cloning follow libgdx's instructions:
https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Intellij-IDEA

If you use Wayland and wish to run on desktop, install xorg-xrandr, otherwise libgdx will be unable to launch a window.
